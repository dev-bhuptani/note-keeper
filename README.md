# Note Keeper

To store all your important notes at one place. You can create new notes, edit, or also can delete.  
As of now, I store all notes in React state, so notes won't be saved permanently. But, will be adding many other functionalities in the future updates.

Technology used: **React.js**  
  
To run the app, first install all node modules by running <code>npm install</code>.  
And after that, simply run the app by running <code>npm start</code>
  
_**Stay tuned for future updates!**_
